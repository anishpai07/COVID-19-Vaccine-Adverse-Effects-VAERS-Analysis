## Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System (VAERS) Analysis for COVID-19 Vaccines. <br>

### About VAERS
Established in 1990, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (possible side effects) after a person has received a vaccination [1].

### Project Goal
Our goal is to analyze COVID-19 vaccination data by exploring the VAERS Vaccination, VAERS Patient Data and VAERS Symptoms datasets [2]. We will not only be exploring three different COVID Vaccines (MODERNA, PFIZER, JANSSEN) related data but will also look into Patient data such as age, any pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, etc. Finally, also want to get an idea of which vaccine has proven to be the most efficient in terms of preventing the recontraction of COVID and minimum resulting symptoms in the patient. 

### Hypothesis 1
Conducting a test to identify which vaccine manufacturer had the lowest count of reported adverse effects. <br>
Note: This is indicative only of the REPORTED cases within the VAERS Datasets, and does not take into account the total number of cases across all vaccinations.

H0: Vaccines manufactured by Moderna have the lowest count of reported adverse effects.
